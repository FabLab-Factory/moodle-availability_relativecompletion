# moodle-availability_relativecompletion

## Introduction 

The Relative completion plugin enables the teacher to make a specific course activity or section available when the **previous activity** or **previous section** has been completed. The availability criteria are thus depending on the relative course activity ordering. The plugin can help course creators to design a learning path that gradually unfolds when students complete learning activities.

The availability restrictions will have no effect when there is currently no previous activity or section. As with all availability restrictions relative completion can be combined with other criteria.
